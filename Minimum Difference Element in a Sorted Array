Perform binary search to find the closest elements around the given key.
Compare the differences between the key and its neighboring elements.
Return the element with the minimum difference.

int binarySearch(int[] arr, int key) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == key) return arr[mid];
        if (arr[mid] < key) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    return (Math.abs(arr[low] - key) < Math.abs(arr[high] - key)) ? arr[low] : arr[high];
}
