Exponential Search: The while loop expands the search range by doubling high until the key is within the range [low, high]. This helps efficiently narrow down where the key might be.
Binary Search: Once the range is found, the binarySearch function is called to search within the bounded range.
Range Limitation: The range for binary search is limited to the array bounds using Math.min(high, arr.length - 1).

class Solution {
    public int exponentialSearch(int[] arr, int key) {
        // Initialize low and high
        int low = 0;
        int high = 1;
        
        // Find the appropriate range by doubling high until key is within range
        while (high < arr.length && key > arr[high]) {
            low = high;
            high = high * 2;
        }

        // Apply binary search within the found range
        return binarySearch(arr, low, high, key);
    }
    
    // Standard binary search within range [low, high]
    private int binarySearch(int[] arr, int low, int high, int key) {
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            
            if (arr[mid] == key) {
                return mid;  // Key found
            } else if (arr[mid] < key) {
                low = mid + 1;  // Search right
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;  // Search left
            }
        }
        return -1;  // Key not found
    }
}
